Green IT is an umbrella term referring to environmentally sound IT hardware, software, systems, applications, and practices.  It encompasses three complementary approaches to improving environmental sustainability.

The way software is  designed, developed, and deployed can have a major impact on energy consumption. Accordingly, companies should include software in their sustainability efforts. They should articulate a strategy that guides trade-offs and allows for flexibility, review and refine the software development life cycle, and use “sustainable” software to make cloud-based data centers greener.
